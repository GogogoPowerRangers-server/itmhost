To remove Cygwin sshd in the cleanest possible way:

cygrunsrv -R sshd

delete the folder c:\cygwin and all its sub-folders

remove the Environment Variable 'CYGWIN'

edit the Environment path accordingly

Start...Run... regedit and delete these two registry trees

"HKEY_CURRENT_USER_Software_Cygnus Solutions"

"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_Software_Cygnus Solutions"

Go to Control Panel, Category View, Performance and Maintenance,
      Administrative Tools, Computer Management.
... or ...
Click Start...Run...compmgmt.msc

Delete the sshd user if it exists in the "System Tools" - "Local Users and Groups" - "Users" section.
